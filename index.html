            <p class="text-muted text-left"> Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago </p>

        <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

<p class="list-group-item-text" col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7>A group of 13 scientists from around the world released a statement on Thursday demanding that health care providers more carefully consider using acetaminophen (APAP) on pregnant women until the drug is investigated for potentially hindering the development of a fetus inside the womb.

The statement, published on Thursday in the journal of Nature Reviews Endocrinology, suggests that “prenatal exposure to APAP might alter fetal development, which could increase the risks of some neurodevelopment, reproductive, urogenital disorders.”</p>

<p class="list-group-item-text" col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7>Carbon dioxide emissions from wildfires in the past two months touched a new high since 2003, from when records have been maintained. 

The cumulative CO2 emissions from violent forest fires in the two months was 2643.4 megatonnes, Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) announced September 21, 2021. 

Wildfires are common during the boreal (of the Northern Hemisphere) fire season that lasts from May to October. But the number of fires, their intensity, region covered and persistence were unusually high this year, said Mark Parrington, senior scientist and wildfire expert at CAMS implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

States in India also recorded some of their biggest wildfires since last year. Odisha, for instance, recorded 51,968 forest fires from November 2020 to June 2021 — the eastern state's highest. 

CAMS analyses data from its Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) collected using fire radiative power measurements from the MODIS satellite by National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The service uses these calculations to make estimates of daily global emissions from fires. </p>
